# Numix-Inspired Fcitx Skin

This skin uses colors from the dark variant of the Numix theme. It is intended to be used with ClassicUI on Fcitx 4.2, and has been tested on version 4.2.9.7.

To use the skin, the `numix_fcitx.fskin` can be downloaded from the releases tab, and then installed by either double-clicking on the file or executing `fcitx-skin-installer numix_fcitx.fskin` within the same directory as the file.

Alternatively, the skin can be generated by cloning this repository and executing `tar -cvf numix_fcitx.fskin numix_fcitx` within the cloned directory.
